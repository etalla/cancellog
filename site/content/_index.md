  heading: Why Kaldi?
  text: Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.
intro:
  heading: What we offer
  text: Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone.
values:
  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.

There’s been much talk of ‘cancel culture’ in the past years. 



The divisive nature of the topic made it hard for me to form an informed view on it. Just as swathes of people have voiced concerns over what they see as a dangerous trend, many affirm that it doesn’t exist. Others still acknowledge it but dismiss it as insignificant or justified. It doesn’t help that each camp usually falls within political party lines.![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Iu3iAUJP5RnapRdXN-AZNcIYCn2l3mJLsbwdIGL0L9G2p-IEN_LnvPb13ydLMW8ilYd9OJutfo9zlsQfqzTWlyIiqawI5nIIb2lrVr0gKz6kkCMqAxKVXGkfjrr7h2LSwuaO1TN5)



I found myself caught up in such conversations. In an effort to see the wood for the trees, I decided to take a dive and see what’s what.
